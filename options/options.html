            Hope you're enjoying this extension. It's totally free for personal use. To make it work synchronized within your company (or group of friends), we would need to rent a server. It takes money, so if you think you or your company could benefit from synchronization between all the users (within the group or worldwide) - <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanist/">contact me</a> - it's going to be a paid option. First 20 companies to pre-order will have maximum available functionality for all the members for 2 years.</br></br>
            I'm going to start the developements once there is enough money to rent a server. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RomanistHere">Stay updated.</a></br></br>
            I don't really need much money, I'm happy to bring some value to this world, means most of not-on-server-spent money is going to help those in need. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wanderlustworker.com/8-ways-to-do-good-things-in-this-world/">Do good things</a>, have a great life. See ya:)
